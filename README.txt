    STORYLINE
        OUR PLANET IS IN DANGER!
        An unknown agressor has launched several nuclear warheads.
        Unfortunately, our only hope for survival is you.
        You're armed with an unusually large catapult and several 
            ridiculously overstuffed pillows.
        The plan is to launch the pillows so they will land under 
            the warheads and cushion the impact.
        
        Be quick, and remember ... only one pillow is enough to 
            save Earth from certain doom!
            
    HOW TO PLAY
        Use the Up/Downs to navigate the menus. Almost any button 
            can be used to select a menu option. ESC quits.
            
        Once in-game, hold down almost any button to choose your 
            angle (you need to time it it right with the moving 
            angle) then the Power bar will start to move. Time 
            your release of the button to launch a pillow with 
            the desired angle and power.
            
        If you get a pillow in the right spot a little early, 
            you can press the down arrow (down on the axis / 
            d-pad for joystick users) to speed up the warhead 
            so you won't get too bored waiting for it to fall.
